## Installation

### Option 1: Download Release

2. Download the latest `AgendaDashboard.exe`.
3. Run the executable - no installation required!

### Option 2: Build from Source
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/armnrd/agenda-dashboard.git
   cd agenda-aashboard
   ```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2019 or later.

3. Restore NuGet packages and build the solution.

## Configuration

1. **Google Calendar API Setup**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Enable the Google Calendar API.
   - Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client ID).
   - Download the credentials JSON file and save it as `gcal_credentials.json` in the same directory as the executable.

2. **Todoist API Setup**:
   - Go to [Todoist App Management](https://todoist.com/app_console).
   - Create a new app to get your API token.
   - Copy your API token and save it in a file named `todoist_credentials.json` in the same directory as the executable. It should look like this:
   ```json
   {
     "api_token": "your_todoist_api_token_here"
   }
   ```

3. **Application Configuration**

The application uses a `settings.json` file for configuration.

```json
{
  "theme": "light",
  "position": {
    "x": 20,
    "y": 20 
  },
  "todoist": {
    "refresh-interval": 60
  },
  "google-calendar": {
    "refresh-interval": 300,
    "ignored-ids": [
      "calendar-id-1@group.calendar.google.com",
      "calendar-id-2@import.calendar.google.com"
    ]
  }
}
```

2. Click the three dots next to a calendar name.
3. Select "Settings and sharing".
4. Scroll down to find the "Calendar ID" section.

## Usage
